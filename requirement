This file specifies the dependencies required to run your project. Make sure to include it in your project directory. Here's how you can create and use the `requirements.txt` file:

1. Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory.
2. Add the following content to the file:
    
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    
3. To install the required libraries, use the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This will ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed in your Python environment.
